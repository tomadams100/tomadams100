### Hi there 👋

Hi, I'm Tom - welcome to my portfolio - I'm a full-stack developer, currently in the UK but looking for opportunities around the world!


## Here's my story....

After four years working in finance, I decided that I wanted to use my skills as a programmer to bring exciting ideas to life and to work on awe inspiring projects.

I have recently completed the Ironhack bootcamp, where I studied full-stack Javascript development, specifically the MERN stack: MongoDB, Express, React, Node.

## Say hi...

Please feel free to reach out - I'm on LinkedIn or email are both fine - and I would love to discuss my adventures in tech with you further! 🙂💻
