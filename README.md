### Hi there 👋

Hi, I'm Tom - welcome to my Github profile - I'm a full-stack developer who is passionate about software, startups, and building cool stuff!


## Here's my story....

After four years working in finance, I decided that I wanted to use my skills as a programmer to bring exciting ideas to life and to work on awe inspiring projects.

I have completed the Ironhack bootcamp, where I studied full-stack Javascript development, specifically the MERN stack: MongoDB, Express, React, Node. After that I worked at an early stage startup called Officely, then moved on to Hive Streaming.

## Say hi...

Please feel free to reach out - I'm on LinkedIn or email are both fine - and I would love to discuss my adventures in tech with you further! 🙂💻
